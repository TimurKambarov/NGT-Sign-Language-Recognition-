# NGT Sign Language Recognition System

> 🚧 **Work in Progress** — This project is currently under active development

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a real-time computer vision system for recognizing Dutch Sign Language (Nederlandse Gebarentaal - NGT) fingerspelling. The system captures hand gestures via camera input, processes them using machine learning techniques, and outputs the corresponding letters or words.

### Goal

Create an accessible learning tool that enables users to practice NGT fingerspelling and receive real-time feedback on their hand movements and positions. This tool is designed to support the approximately 30,000 people in the Netherlands who use NGT as their primary language.

### Key Features (Planned)

- ✅ Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe Hand Landmarks
- ✅ Face mesh detection for body-relative hand positioning
- ✅ Signing zone validation (ensures hand is at proper height)
- 🔲 Letter recognition for static and dynamic NGT alphabet signs
- 🔲 Feedback system to indicate correctness of signing
- 🔲 Data collection module for building training dataset
- 🔲 User-friendly interface (Streamlit-based UI perhaps?)

## Technical Approach

### Detection Pipeline

The system uses a two-model approach:

1. **MediaPipe Hands** — Detects 21 hand landmarks per hand (wrist, knuckles, fingertips)
2. **MediaPipe Face Mesh** — Detects face landmarks to establish body reference points

### Why Face Detection?

Proper NGT fingerspelling requires the hand to be positioned at shoulder/face height. By tracking the face, we can:

- Calculate hand position **relative to the body** (not just the camera frame)
- Validate that the user is signing in the correct zone
- Normalize measurements so they work at any distance from camera

### Hand Position Normalization

Hand coordinates are normalized in two ways:

| Normalization | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Relative to wrist | Hand shape recognition (independent of position) |
| Relative to face | Hand position validation (proper signing posture) |

### Classification Approach (Planned)

Landmark sequences will be classified using traditional ML algorithms:

- **Random Forest** — Primary approach (robust, provides feature importance)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors** — Alternative for small datasets
- **FastDTW** — For dynamic letters requiring movement (H, J, Z)

## Current Files

### `main.py`

Basic hand + face detection script that:
- Opens webcam and detects hands AND face simultaneously
- Visualizes 21 MediaPipe landmarks on each hand
- Displays hand label (Left/Right)
- Supports mirror mode toggle
- Calculates hand position relative to face (nose as origin)
- Displays signing zone (yellow rectangle)
- Shows whether hand is IN or OUT of proper signing zone
- Normalizes landmarks relative to wrist (for shape recognition)
- Normalizes position relative to face size (works at any distance)

**Controls:** `q` = quit, `m` = toggle mirror, `z` = toggle zone visibility

## NGT Alphabet Reference

The Dutch Sign Language alphabet includes 26 letters:

- **Static signs** — Hand held in fixed position (e.g., A, B, C, D, E)
- **Dynamic signs** — Hand moves during the sign (e.g., H, J, Z)

## MediaPipe Landmarks Reference
